# EdTech-Assignment-Tracker
EdTech Assignment Tracker is a web app for teachers and students to manage assignments. Teachers create tasks and view submissions, while students browse and submit their work. Its backend uses Django (Python), DRF, and JWT for a secure, role-based API. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for a responsive user interface.
